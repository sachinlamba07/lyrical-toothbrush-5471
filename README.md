#Project Title: Flickster - 5-Day project with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap

#Project Description:
Flickster is a dynamic web project that aims to replicate the key features and user experience of the Zee5 online streaming platform. Created within a 5-day timeframe, this project will employ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to recreate Zee5's user interface and functionalities. The primary features include movie searching by name and genre, categorizing content into different sections, and enabling video playback via YouTube upon clicking on a movie.

#Key Features:

Homepage Redesign: Develop a responsive homepage using Bootstrap components, mimicking Zee5's design. Display featured content, trending shows, and recent additions.

Dynamic Navigation Bar: Implement a navigation bar that adapts to various screen sizes with Bootstrap's responsive features. Include sections like movies, TV shows, news, web series, and sports.

Advanced Search Functionality: Create a search bar that enables users to search for movies by name and genre. Implement JavaScript to provide real-time suggestions as users type.

Categorized Sections: Design separate sections for movies, TV shows, news, web series, and sports. Each section should showcase relevant content with thumbnail images and brief descriptions.

Video Playback via YouTube: Integrate JavaScript to enable video playback on YouTube. When a user clicks on a movie, the project should seamlessly open the movie trailer on YouTube in a new window or modal.

Responsive Design: Ensure the website's responsiveness across various devices by leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and media queries.
